# Periculi

## What's dis?

This is a risk assessment framework app, specifically designed for _FIRST_ robotics teams! It has three scoring criteria, likelihood (how often it happens), risk (how bad it'll be if it happens), and detectability (how hard it is to detect and prevent it). It uses those three criteria to calculate a score for how bad a hazard is. Once you have a plan to mitigate a risk, you can enter that in, and once it's actually implemented you can mark it as such.

## What in the world does Periculi mean?

It just means "risk" in Latin :skull:
